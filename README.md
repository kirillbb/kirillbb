Hi I'm a dotnet developer from Ukraine. I'm looking to work remotely or in an office.     
I got interested in programming at school. In this regard, I chose the system programming in NTU KhPI, where I studied C++ and a little bit of Java.   
In the process of learning, I discovered C#. I liked it for its simplicity, beauty, and especially the garbage collector :)
